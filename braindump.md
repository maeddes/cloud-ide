About me

Why? Reason for this talk - scenario at lecture

Requirements:
- Consistent environment for multiple programming languages and frameworks
- git-based
- Container Runtime availability
- Lightweight, ideally independent of local machine
- fast access, ideally no setup necessary
- Easy to share (and present)


- 12-factor X Dev/Prod Parity 
    - idea to keep environments between dev, test and prod as consistent as possible
    - the tool gap
- Dev/Dev parity
    - make development environments as identical as possible
    - consistency in versions of Java, Maven, Gradle, Docker etc.
    - fast onboarding
    - (not so relevant in a proper CICD environment setup)
